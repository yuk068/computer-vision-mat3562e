# MAT3562E - 3 (2025): Computer Vision Course Assignments and Notebooks

### GitHub repo: [MAT3562E - Computer Vision](https://github.com/yuk068/computer-vision-mat3562e)

- This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my assignments and Jupyter notebooks for the ***[MAT3562E - 3] Computer Vision*** course at ***Hanoi University of Science (HUS) - Vietnam National University (VNU)***.
- The repository aims to document my learning journey and provide a valuable resource for future reference.
- From my last [MAT3533 - Machine Learning](https://github.com/yuk068/machine-learning-mat3533) repository, I've gained quite a bit of experience and hope to better improve the quality of this repo.
- Feel free to explore the repository's contents and leverage the materials for your own learning and research.
- There are also a lot of dummy image data in the repository should you need some quick setup.

- I might cover some of the contents in more detail at my blog: [Yuk's Blog](https://yuk068.github.io/)
